<ul>
<li><strong>Debt finance</strong> – money is borrowed from a lender for the business, e.g. getting a bank loan.</li>
<li><strong>Equity finance</strong> – money is provided in exchange for owning a part of the business, e.g. having shareholders.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to each type of finance. </p>
<p>Read about the <a href="">types of finance</a> at WA Small Business Development Corporation.</p>
<h3>Debt finance</h3>
<p>Debt finance is when you get money in the form of debt from a lender, which will have conditions on how the money will be repaid. </p>
<p>The advantages of debt finance include:</p>
<ul>
<li>you’ll still have full control of your business (no shareholders)</li>
<li>you’ll still fully own the profits from your business</li>
<li>the interest you pay in your repayments is tax deductible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages of debt finance include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the debt will need to be repaid</li>
<li>most debts will incur interest</li>
<li>it can be difficult to secure a debt if you’re just starting out</li>
<li>you risk bankruptcy if you are unable to repay your debts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common sources of debt funding include:</p>
<ul>
<li>financial institutions – loans and other finance products from banks, building societies, credit unions etc.</li>
<li>retailers – some retailers offer store credit so you can buy goods and pay them off later.</li>
<li>suppliers – some suppliers offer supplier credit where you can delay payment for supplies.</li>
<li>finance companies – generally can offer finance through retailers.</li>
<li>family and friends – may be able to offer loans, though it’s important to consider how this will affect your relationship and make sure the terms of the loan are well documented and understood.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="equity">Equity finance</h3>
<p>Equity finance is when money is provided in return for owning a part of your business.  While the money provided does not need to be returned, it does allow the provider to gain returns from the profit you make in your business.</p>
<p>Advantages of equity funding can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>not having debt that needs to be repaid</li>
<li>having less risk than debt finance as you do not owe any money</li>
<li>having a network of business contacts and skills through your investors who want you to succeed</li>
<li>possibly getting follow-up funding as your business grows from your investors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages of equity funding include:</p>
<ul>
<li>sharing ownership of the business with your investors – as they’ve invested in your business, investors will also have a share in business decisions </li>
<li>needing time and money to make your business ready to present to potential investors</li>
<li>needing time to research and find the right investors for your business</li>
<li>risk of affecting your relationship with your investors should the business fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some common sources of equity funding include:</p>
<ul>
<li>self-funding – if your business is self-funded, it means you won’t need to share ownership with anyone, but you also run the risk of losing all your business investment should it fail.  </li>
<li>family or friends – can provide finance for your business in return for a share of the profits.</li>
<li>private investors – you may be able to find private investors for your business if you can present an attractive idea and strong business plan. </li>
<li>venture capitalists – large corporations sometimes will invest large amounts into start-up businesses with potential for high growth and large profits.</li>
<li>stock market – you can publicly offer shares of your business to raise capital. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
<p>If you're an Early Stage Innovation Company (ESIC) looking for investors, those who purchase new shares in your company may be eligible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>a non-refundable carry forward tax offset. This tax offset is generally equal to 20% of the amount paid to acquire the shares, up to a maximum offset of $200,000 per year.</li>
<li>modified capital gains tax treatment, where capital gains on shares that are held for between 1 – 10 years are disregarded (capital losses made during this period must also be disregarded).</li>
</ul>

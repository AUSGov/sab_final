<li><strong>R&amp;D</strong> – stands for 'research and development'. Businesses conduct research and development to innovate, create new products and find better ways of doing things.</li>
<li><strong>Receipts</strong> – a document given to a customer to confirm payment and to confirm the sale of a good or service.</li>
<li><strong><a href="">Record keeping</a> </strong>– the process of keeping or recording information that explains certain business transactions. Record keeping is a requirement under tax law.</li>
<li><strong>Refinance</strong> – when a new loan helps to pay off an existing one. Reasons to refinance include: extending the original loan over a longer period of time, reduce fees or interest rates, switch banks, or move from a fixed to variable loan.</li>
<li><strong>Rent to buy</strong> – a finance arrangement where you purchase something through an initial deposit and then 'lease' it while pay it off. After the final payment, the purchaser has the option (but no obligation) to buy the good or continue leasing. See also <a href="">Hire-purchase</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Repossess</strong> – the process of a bank or other lender taking ownership of property/assets for the purpose of paying off a loan in default.</li>
<li><strong>Retention of title</strong> – a clause in contracts where a buyer may receive property, but doesn’t take legal ownership until the full price is paid.</li>
<li><strong>Return on investment</strong> (ROI) – a calculation that works out how efficient a business is at generating profit from the original equity from the owners/shareholders. It's a way of thinking about the benefit (return) of the money you invest into the business. To calculate ROI, divide the gain (net profit) of the investment by the cost of the investment. The ROI then becomes a percentage or a ratio.</li>
<li><strong>Return on investment (ROI) formula </strong>example – Annie buys $1000 worth of stocks and sells the stocks a year later for $1500. The net profit is $500. ROI = (500/1000) = 0.5 x 100 = 50%. Annie's ROI on the stocks is 50%.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> (also known as turnover) – the amount earned before expenses, tax and other deductions.</li>

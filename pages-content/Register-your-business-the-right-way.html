It is sometimes known as your trading name.</p>
<p>If your business name isn’t the same as your name, you’ll need to <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">register for a business name</a>. This will link your business name and ABN.</p>
<p>For example, John Smith won’t need to register a business name if he runs a business under the name John Smith. However, if he runs his business under any other name (e.g. John’s cars), he will need to register John’s Cars as his business name.</p>
<p>The Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) maintains a list of registered business names for you to <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">check that your business name is available</a> before you register. </p>
<p>It’s important to note that registering a business name with ASIC doesn’t protect your business name from being used by someone else. To protect your business name and brand, you will also need to <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">register it as a trade mark</a> with IP Australia.</p>

Pay your tax by PAYG instalments</h3>
<p><a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pay as you go (PAYG) instalments</a> are regular payments you make throughout the year (usually quarterly) towards your expected yearly tax bill. You can pay your PAYG instalments using your business activity statement (BAS) if you’re registered for GST. If not, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) will send you an instalment activity statement (IAS).</p>
<p>Using the PAYGI system is a good idea, because once you’re in business, it’s up to you to set aside enough money to pay your tax.</p>
<p>There are two ways to start <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">paying PAYG instalments</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>voluntary entry</li>
<li>automatic entry, where the ATO will automatically add you to the PAYG instalments system when your business or investment income reaches a <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">certain level</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Voluntary entry</h4>
<p>If you think you're going to make a profit on your business or investment income, you can voluntarily enter the PAYG instalments system. This reduces the chances of having to pay a large amount for tax at the end of the year.</p>
<p>You can voluntarily enter into PAYG instalments:</p>
<ul>
<li>online (via <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">myGov</a>) if you’re a sole trader</li>
<li>by calling the ATO on 13 28 66.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use a tax agent or BAS agent, make sure to discuss this option with them before using the myGov service.</p>
<p>You can also make voluntary <a href="">pre-payments</a> at any time towards an expected tax bill without entering the PAYG instalments system.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Automatic entry</h4>
<p>The ATO will contact you after you lodge a tax return with business and/or investment income to let you know if you need to start paying PAYG instalments. They will tell you about the options available to calculate your instalments and how often you need to pay.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>If you employ staff or other workers you will have additional tax and super responsibilities, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>withholding tax from your employees’ pay</li>
<li>making super contributions to their nominated super fund.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on how you pay your employees, you may also need to register for and pay <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fringe benefits tax</a>.</p>

<p>When you make payments to employees, some contractors and other businesses, you need to withhold an amount from the payment and send it to the ATO. This is called <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PAYG withholding</a>, and prevents workers from having a large amount of tax to pay at the end of the financial year.</p>
<p>You'll need to withhold tax from your payments if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have employees</li>
<li>you have other workers, such as contractors, and you enter into voluntary agreements to withhold amounts from your payments to them</li>
<li>you make payments to businesses that don't quote their Australian Business Number (ABN).</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to be registered for PAYG withholding before you pay your workers, so that you can deduct the correct amount of tax and send it to the ATO.</p>

Some examples of fringe benefits are:</p>

<li>providing car parking, even if the employee uses their own car to travel to work</li>

<p>If you provide your employees with fringe benefits you’ll need to <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">register</a> for and pay fringe benefits tax (FBT).

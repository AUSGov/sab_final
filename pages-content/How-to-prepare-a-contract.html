If the contract is long term, it may be worth including a review clause in the contract that enables your fees to be reviewed if business costs increase.</li>
                                                                    <li><strong>Hourly or daily rate</strong> - If you’re getting paid according to the number of hours or days you work, the contract should state how many hours make up a standard working day. You may also wish to specify how many days a week you’ll work. It should set out the fees that are payable for one hour's work and/or one day's work. The contract should always state whether GST is included in the fee (if GST is payable). Contracts that specify hourly or daily rates often require monthly payments.</li>

The contract should clearly describe all milestones so there are no disputes about when a task is considered complete.</li>
                                                                    <li><strong>Part payment up front, the rest paid on completion</strong> - This arrangement can be used to cover start-up or one-off costs for the contract such as the purchase of materials.</li>

This allows you to recover some or all of your costs if the project does not go ahead or is cancelled before you complete the work. You’ll need evidence of your losses.

Insist that the ADR practitioner is qualified and currently registered as an ADR practitioner.

For example, the price of materials may increase or the result aimed for may change. If both parties agree to a variation, a court can enforce it. It is common for contract changes to occur verbally, but it’s important to keep written records of any changes.</p>

You should not agree to a term that allows only one party to change the description of work. Think carefully about the conditions you place on agreeing to a variation term because it can affect your costs or your ability to complete the work on time.</p>

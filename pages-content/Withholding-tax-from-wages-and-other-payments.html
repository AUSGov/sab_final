This is called PAYG withholding, and works to prevent workers from having a large amount of tax to pay at the end of the financial year.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<ul>
<li><a href="">register for PAYG withholding</a> before you are required to withhold from a payment</li>
<li><a href="">pay the amounts you’ve withheld</a> from wages and other payments to the ATO </li>
<li>report the amounts on your activity statements</li>
<li>provide PAYG withholding <a href="">payment summaries</a> to all employees and other payees</li>
<li>lodge a PAYG withholding <a href="">annual report</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most <a href="">common payments you will need to withhold amounts from</a> are the ones you make to:</p>
<ul>
<li>employees</li>
<li>directors</li>
<li>workers you have a <a href="">voluntary agreement</a> with</li>
<li>contractors or businesses that <a href="">don't quote their Australian Business Number</a> (ABN) to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ATO has calculators to help you work out how much you need to withhold from payments:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="">Tax withheld for individuals calculator</a> – for payments made to employees and other workers.</li>
<li><a href="">Voluntary agreement calculator</a> – for payments made to workers, such as subcontractors, who are subject to a voluntary agreement.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use the <a href="">Tax tables</a> to work out how much you need to withhold from payments.</p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
<p>If you operate your business as a sole trader or partnership and you take out amounts from the business for personal use, this is not a wage and you don't have to withhold from these amounts. However, this income will need to be included in your tax return. </p>
<p>You can still make payments towards your income tax liability through <a href="">PAYG instalments</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>pay the amount to the ATO</li>
<li>report the amounts on your activity statements</li>
<li>lodge an annual report.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When to pay</h3>
<p>The <a href="">due date for paying amounts</a> you withhold depends on whether you're a small or medium withholder.</p>
<ul>
<li>Small withholders withhold less than $25,000 per year, and are required to pay quarterly to the ATO.</li>
<li>Medium withholders withhold more than $25,000 to $1 million per year, and are required to pay monthly. </li>
<li>If you withhold more than $1 million per year, you are a large withholder and will need to pay within six to eight days of when you’ve withheld the payment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to pay</h3>
<p>You can easily pay through a number of methods, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>online</li>
<li>BPay </li>
<li>credit card and phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Find out more about <a href="">how to pay the ATO</a>.</p>
<h3>How to report</h3>
<p>You report PAYG withholding on your <a href="">Business Activity Statement (BAS)</a>.</p>
<h3>Annual reporting</h3>
<p>At the end of each financial year, you need to give each of your payees (i.e. your employees and anyone else you’ve withheld payment from) a payment summary. You must also provide an annual report to the ATO.</p>
<h4>Payment summaries</h4>
<p>A payment summary should be provided to your payees by no later than 14 July each year, and needs to specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>how much you paid them in the financial year</li>
<li>how much you withheld from the payments.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you lodge your PAYG withholding reports online you can provide your workers with <a href="">electronic payment summaries</a> as long as these meet the formatting requirements.</p>
<p>For assistance on what to include in a payment summary, and guidelines for each different type of payment summary, read the ATO’s information on <a href="">PAYG payment summaries: forms and guidelines</a>.</p>
<h4>Annual report</h4>
<p>If you’ve withheld from payments, you will also need to lodge a PAYG withholding <a href="">annual report</a> at the end of each financial year. The report must include:</p>
<ul>
<li>all payments you made to employees, workers or businesses during the financial year</li>
<li>the amounts you withheld from those payments.</li>
</ul>

Leasing requires less commitment than buying and makes it simple to upgrade when your lease finishes. However, there may be restrictions in place on what you can do with the plant, equipment and vehicles you lease, depending on your contract.</p>

If you don’t have sufficient cash to buy it outright, there are finance products available to help you. The financier will keep an interest in your plant, equipment or vehicle until they’re paid back. Buying will mean more commitment, as you won’t be able to simply return it after a lease runs out. It also means you have freedom to make alterations to fit your needs.</p>

                                                                <ul>
                                                                    <li>Make sure you deal with reputable companies who will help you work out the best option.</li>
                                                                    <li>Don’t just take the first deal you’re offered – shopping around can often secure you a much better deal. This includes shopping around for a good rate if you’re taking out a car loan.</li>
                                                                    <li>If you decide to lease your vehicle, consider how much you can afford to pay each month.</li>

                                                                </ul>
                                                                <p>If you’re still unsure whether it’s better for you to buy or lease, seek advice from your registered tax professional or financial adviser to help you make the best financial decision for your business.</p>
                                                                <h3>Financing options to help you buy a vehicle</h3>
                                                                <p>If you want to buy but don’t have enough finance to pay upfront, your business can obtain finance through a bank or other financial institution. Generally the loan will be secured by using the car as a guarantee. </p>
                                                                <p>If you purchase your car from a dealership, they often will have financing available as an option. Make sure you do your research before signing up for dealer financing options, as they may include rates and fees that add to the cost. Dealer finance can also include a large payment at the end known as a ‘balloon’ or ‘residual’ payment. This is designed to lower your ongoing repayments, but you will need to plan ahead for how you will fund this lump sum when the finance term ends.</p>

                                                                <p>When buying equipment for your business, it’s important that you shop around for the best deal that suits your needs. You should also carefully assess the long-term value of each piece of equipment you’re purchasing.</p>
                                                                <p>Before you buy, consider these eight tips:</p>
                                                                <ol class="body-copy-list-order">
                                                                    <li>
                                                                        <p><strong>Make a list</strong> - It’s important to first create a list of your equipment needs and wants before you start purchasing. This list should form part of your business plan and be something you continue to update and revise as your business grows. </p>
                                                                        <p>Check out our <a href="">Plan for success</a> module for more on business planning.</p>

                                                                    <li>
                                                                        <p><strong>Check if there are items you can outsource</strong> - As part of your list, identify what you might be able to outsource instead of having to purchase the equipment. For example, you may be able to get by without a copier or printer and pay for external printing services to cut down on your initial capital investment and to avoid cluttering your workspace.</p>
                                                                    </li>
                                                                    <li>
                                                                        <p><strong>Design your space</strong> - No matter the kind of business you have; a salon, restaurant, office or retail store, it’s important to have accurate measurements of your workspace before you buy your equipment. </p>
                                                                        <p>Measure the area where you plan to place your equipment to find out the dimensions you’ll need. You could also use a digital space planning tool to first digitally design your space and work out the furniture and fixtures you need. </p>
                                                                    </li>
                                                                    <li>
                                                                        <p><strong>Work out if you are buying new or used</strong> – While you may prefer to buy everything new, when you’re working with a limited budget, you can save money by buying some of your equipment second hand. Consider what equipment you need to buy new and what equipment you may be able to buy used.</p>
                                                                    </li>
                                                                    <li>
                                                                        <p><strong>Choose quality over price</strong> – Don’t simply look at the price when deciding what to purchase. If a piece of equipment frequently breaks down or doesn’t meet your needs, it could end up costing you more than if you had purchased something more expensive in the first place. While price is important in deciding what to purchase, the greater focus should be on quality and value.</p>
                                                                        <p>If you find a deal on something you need, take the time to do some research on the model. Looking at consumer reviews and feedback can give you an indication of whether the item is good quality and will meet your needs. </p>
                                                                    </li>
                                                                    <li>
                                                                        <p><strong>Check if there is a local repairer for your equipment</strong> – If your equipment requires repairs, having a local repairer who can fix it can save you time and money. It’s also a good idea to check if spare parts required for your equipment are readily available or can be imported. </p>
                                                                    </li>
                                                                    <li>
                                                                        <p><strong>Consider what your most important items are</strong> - For the critical items you need to run your business, you might consider spending a little extra for better quality and reliability.</p>
                                                                        <p>For example, if you’re running a restaurant, it’s important to make sure your critical items such as knives, ranges and pots and pans can produce quality food while withstanding heavy use. </p>
                                                                    </li>
                                                                    <li>
                                                                        <p><strong>Check your available cash</strong> - If you don’t have enough cash to cover the cost of all of your equipment needs, there are financing options such as a small business loan or buying through a hire purchase agreement. If you choose to get finance through these options, consider the interest rate and how long you’ll take to pay back the amount owed. Talk to your financial advisor or tax professional if you are unsure.</p>

<p>As a contractor you’re operating a business that produces a result for an agreed price. In most cases you’re a contractor if you: </p>
<ul>
<li>are paid for results achieved</li>
<li>provide all or most of the necessary materials and equipment to complete the work</li>
<li>are free to delegate work to others</li>
<li>have freedom in the way you work</li>
<li>provide services to other businesses</li>
<li>are free to accept or refuse work</li>
<li>are in a position to make a profit or loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you to determine the difference between contractors and employees, read our <a href="">Employee or contractor?</a> page.</p>
<p>If you’re an employer, visit the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)’s <a href="">differences between employees and contractors page</a> to work out if your worker is an employee or contractor for tax and super purposes.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>You can receive PSI in almost any industry, trade or profession. However, some common examples include financial professionals, information technology consultants, engineers, construction workers, and medical practitioners. PSI does not affect you if you're an employee receiving only salary and wages.</p>
<p>Income is classified as PSI when more than 50% of the amount you received for a contract was for your labour, skills or expertise. </p>
<h3><strong>Did you know?</strong></h3>
<p>If you have earned PSI, it’s important to understand whether the PSI rules apply to you, as it will affect the range of deductions you may claim in your business and your reporting requirements.</p>
<p>You can receive PSI even if you're not a sole trader. If you're producing PSI through a company, partnership or trust and the PSI rules apply, the income will be treated as your individual income for tax purposes.</p>

Planning allows you to manage risks, identify opportunities, and set goals.</p>
<p><a href="">Developing a business plan</a> can help you identify and develop responses to common issues that you may face as a contractor, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>approaching and securing contracts from potential hirers</li>
<li>managing annual holidays and sick leave</li>
<li>managing your relationship with your hirers</li>
<li>protecting and dealing with any intellectual property you develop</li>
<li>managing your superannuation, taxation and legal requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these issues will also be useful when you are negotiating contracts with hirers. For more information, check out <a href="">Business plans</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<div id="react_0HLTC2K1JS63O"><div class="anchor-section" data-reactroot="" name="setting-a-price-for-your-services"><a href="" id="setting-a-price-for-your-services"></a><div style="margin-bottom:20px"><div style="background-color:;padding-bottom:"><div id="react_0HLTC2K1JS63N"><div class="c-wrapper c-wrapper-bg-transparent container-fluid" data-reactroot="" style="background-color:"><div class="row"><div class="c-padding-top anchor-section-full-width c-padding-bottom col-sm-8 offset-sm-2 col-md-8 offset-md-2"><div class="body-copy"><div><div class="body-copy-headline col-12"><h2>Setting a price for your services</h2> </div><hr/></div><div class="body-copy-content"><p>One of the most important decisions you will make as a contractor is how much to charge for your services. You need to consider whether you will charge hourly or provide a fixed quote. The rate you charge should cover costs like:</p>
<ul>
<li>insurance</li>
<li>tax</li>
<li>workers' compensation</li>
<li>leave provisions</li>
<li>superannuation</li>
<li>training and licensing fees</li>
</ul>
<p>You should agree to the amount you charge for your services with your hirer before commencing any work and write this into your contract. For more information, have a look at <a href="">Selling, manufacturing and sourcing products</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
</div></div></div></div>
<div id="react_0HLTC2K1JS63Q"><div class="anchor-section" data-reactroot="" name="contracts"><a href="" id="contracts"></a><div style="margin-bottom:20px"><div style="background-color:;padding-bottom:"><div id="react_0HLTC2K1JS63P"><div class="c-wrapper c-wrapper-bg-transparent container-fluid" data-reactroot="" style="background-color:"><div class="row"><div class="c-padding-top anchor-section-full-width c-padding-bottom col-sm-8 offset-sm-2 col-md-8 offset-md-2"><div class="body-copy"><div><div class="body-copy-headline col-12"><h2>Contracts</h2> </div><hr/></div><div class="body-copy-content"><p>When taking on work as a contractor, you will enter into a contract with your hirer. It is important for you to have a written contract so everything is clearly stated. Consider contacting your lawyer, industry association, or business advisor for help or advice.</p>
<p>By better <a href="">understanding the contracts</a> you enter into, you will be better placed to negotiate contracts that work for you. A well planned contract allows contractors and hirers to identify the working relationship, rights, responsibilities, and expected outcomes before starting work, and will help prevent misunderstandings in the future.</p>
<h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
<p><a href="">Intellectual Property</a> (IP) is an essential tool to protect your ideas and the work you generate as a contractor.</p>
<p><strong>IP comes from applying your mind or intellect to create something new or original. IP can exist in varying forms, such as an invention, an idea, or a design.</strong></p>
<p>Ownership of IP for hirer and contractor relationships is treated differently to employer and employee relationships.</p>
<ul>
<li>IP created by an employee is considered the property of their employer.</li>
<li>IP created by a contractor for a hirer is by law considered the property of the contractor, unless otherwise stated in the contract.</li>
</ul>
<p>The contract between the hirer and contractor should clearly outline ownership of any IP resulting from the work. This will prevent confusion or disputes over the IP at the end of the agreement.</p>
<p>Without a written contract that states IP ownership will belong to your hirer, you will automatically own the IP. If your hirer wishes to own the IP, this must be specifically outlined in the contract. To make sure your ideas are protected, it might be a good idea to seek legal advice about clauses relating to IP before signing a contract.</p>
<h3>Dispute resolution</h3>
<p>Disputes between hirers and contractors can arise due to breaches of the contract such as unpaid money or substandard work performance. While many disputes can be resolved through clear communication and negotiation, it’s important to make sure there is a dispute resolution clause in your contract. </p>
<p>You can check out our information on <a href="">disputes</a> for more general information.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>You may also enter into a <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">voluntary agreement</a> with your hirer that will enable the hirer to withhold tax for you. </p>

Contractors and hirers have legal responsibilities under Work Health and Safety legislation, which is governed by Australian, state, and territory WHS agencies.</p>
<p>As a contractor you are entitled to a safe and healthy workplace. When starting at a new workplace, you should be given a safety induction to the workplace and have relevant work processes clearly explained to you.</p>
<p>As a worker, you also need to comply with certain duties set out under the WHS laws, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensuring that your actions do not put yourself or others at risk</li>
<li>letting the appropriate people know about any workplace hazards</li>
<li>reporting accidents and injuries.</li>
</ul>

Depending on what was agreed in the contract, both the contractor and the hirer may have liability insurance and workers’ compensation obligations.</p>
<p>You should consider obtaining personal accident and illness insurance to ensure that you’re financially secure should any accident or illness prevent you from working.</p>
<p>Liability insurance protects you in cases where you are found liable for damages to others, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>a third party death or injury</li>
<li>loss or damage of property or monetary loss as a result of your negligence </li>
<li>damage or loss as a result of advice you gave, or your provision of unsafe products or services.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can take out a number of different types of liability insurance including, public or product liability and professional indemnity.</p>
<p>Asset and revenue insurance protects you in the event of burglary, natural disaster, machinery breakdown, and other forms of damage. As a contractor, it’s likely that most of the equipment you use during the course of your contract will be your own, so you should consider asset and revenue insurance to help minimise the financial risk.</p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
<p>If you work from home, you should make sure that you have the correct level of insurance to protect your business. In many cases, home and contents insurance does not cover home-based businesses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that you are also protected from incidents including natural disaster, fire or theft. </li>
<li>Many insurance policies don’t cover tools of trade, office furniture or computer equipment used for your business – you may need to advise your insurer that you require cover for your business assets.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="">Insurance</a> and workers' compensation has more information about arranging and managing your business insurance. </p>
<h3>Workers’ compensation</h3>
<p>Workers’ compensation is covered by state or territory laws which ensure benefits are paid to an employee or an employee’s family if the worker suffers a job-related injury, death or disease.</p>
<p>As a contractor you may not necessarily be entitled to workers’ compensation unless you have arranged your own accident protection insurance. However, you may be covered as a contractor in some states and specific circumstances. To find out more, check your state or territory legislation in our <a href="">work health and safety</a> information.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

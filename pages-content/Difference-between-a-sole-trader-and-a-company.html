            The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) treats the money you earn in your sole trader business as your individual income. This means you are also responsible for any tax your business must pay.</p>
<p>You can claim deductions for costs incurred in running your business.</p>
<p>You can withdraw money from your business bank account.</p>
</td>
<td data-title="Company">
<p>
            Money the company earns belongs to the company. Even if you own the company (you are a shareholder), the money belongs to the company.</p>
<p>A separate business bank account is mandatory for a company.</p>
<p>As a director, the company may pay you wages or directors’ fees, but you cannot draw money from the company as personal drawings.</p>

<div id="react_0HLTC2K1J6RSL"><div class="anchor-section" data-reactroot="" name="managing-your-stock"><a href="" id="managing-your-stock"></a><div style="margin-bottom:20px"><div style="background-color:;padding-bottom:"><div id="react_0HLTC2K1J6RSK"><div class="c-wrapper c-wrapper-bg-transparent container-fluid" data-reactroot="" style="background-color:"><div class="row"><div class="c-padding-top anchor-section-full-width c-padding-bottom col-sm-8 offset-sm-2 col-md-8 offset-md-2"><div class="body-copy"><div><div class="body-copy-headline col-12"><h2>Managing your stock</h2> </div><hr/></div><div class="body-copy-content"><p>While it’s important to make sure you have enough stock for your business, having a lot of stock on hand can be costly when you take into account things such as storage, insurance, stock losses and the deterioration of stock.</p>
<p><a href="">Managing your business inventory (stock)</a> will help you maintain a good level of stock to meet customer demands while balancing that with the cost of storing that stock.</p>
<ul>
<li>When buying stock, you should think about the shelf life of the goods, the minimum level of stock you need on hand and how long it will take for reordered stock to arrive.</li>
<li>If you stock food or other perishable items, you need to sell the older stock first so it doesn't deteriorate or spoil when you are storing it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> </p>
<p>If you are thinking about <a href="">using stock from your business for personal use</a>, there are some tax rules you should be aware of.</p>
<h3>Stock control</h3>
<p>In order to manage your stock, you need to keep track of the stock you sell and <a href="">set up a stock control process</a>. To track your stock, consider putting in place a manual or computer-based stock control system:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="">Manual systems</a> are best suited to businesses that only need a small amount of stock. There are a number of methods you could use, such as keeping a stock book. Your system should easily allow you to know how much stock you have on hand, work out when you need to reorder stock, and tell you information about each item’s value, location and the date it was received.</li>
<li><a href="">Computer based programs</a> can help make managing your business stock levels easier and may also include a scanner and point of sale machine. </li>
</ul>
<p>More information on stock control:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn how to <a href="">set up a stock control process</a> on the Business Victoria website.</li>
<li>Read about <a href="">stock control</a> on the Queensland Business and Industry Portal.</li>
<li>Find out about perpetual or periodic inventory systems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stocktake</h3>
<p>Some businesses need to complete a stocktake at the end of each income year (or as close as possible). You’ll need to do a stocktake if either your:</p>
<ul>
<li>business turnover for the income year is over $2million</li>
<li>stock level increases or decreases by more than $5,000 from the beginning to the end of the income year (see how you can <a href="">estimate the stock value</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of a stocktake is to work out the value of your stock because an increase or decrease can be treated as part of your income or claimed as a deduction.</p>
<ul>
<li>An increase in your trading stock’s value over the financial year is included in income.</li>
<li>A decrease is a deduction you can claim.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information about <a href="">stocktakes</a> on the ATO website.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

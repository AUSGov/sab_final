<ul>
<li>retail premises</li>
<li>a home-based office</li>
<li>warehouses, manufacturing plants or storage facilities</li>
<li>shared commercial offices or hubs</li>
<li>temporary premises, like a <a href="">market stall</a> or pop-up shop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on your business needs you may even have more than one type of premises, for example, you could have a warehouse to store goods and a shopfront to sell them.</p>
<p>Even if you run your business online, you’ll still need somewhere to operate your business from, such as a place for your computer, or a place to store your stock. This could mean renting a commercial space, or simply running your business from your home. See <a href="">getting started online</a> for information about online business.</p>

<p>The type of business that you run can help guide your choice of location. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A small online business or a tradesman who simply keeps their tools and work vehicles at home may want to save on expenses by running their business from a home office.</li>
<li>Retailers may do better if they are close to shopping areas, tourist attractions, or places with good parking or public transport.</li>
<li>Service providers might need to be located in an office space that’s suitable for customer and business meetings. </li>
<li>Manufacturers may need to look for locations in industrial areas that are close to major highways or freight infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
<p>When choosing a location for your business, make sure to <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">research your business location</a>, and look at things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>how close you need to be to your customers, clients and suppliers</li>
<li>whether there is parking available for customers or if the location is easily accessible by public transport</li>
<li>whether your facilities can receive deliveries of goods</li>
<li>how big you need the space to be for your current and possible future business needs</li>
<li>whether there is enough storage room for your business needs, or whether you would need to consider having separate shopfront and warehouse premises.</li>

The system allows Australian manufacturers to apply for anti-dumping or countervailing duties where they believe dumped or subsidised goods being imported into Australia are harming their business.</p>
<p>Dumping is not prohibited or illegal under the World Trade Organisation international agreements, however it is defined as <a href="">anti-competitive behaviour</a>.</p>
<p>Anti-dumping policy and regulation is important. It provides a trade remedy when imports are dumped and/or subsidised and have:</p>
<ul class="body-copy-list-dot">
<li>caused or are causing material injury to an Australian industry</li>
<li>threatened or would or might cause material injury to an Australian industry</li>
<li>materially hindered the establishment of an Australian industry</li>

<p>In 2016, Australia’s only producer of chrome bar, and also an SME, was severely affected by cheap imported chrome bar. Following a robust investigation, the Australian Government took action to level the playing field for its domestic industry. They did this by imposing anti-dumping duties.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>A <a href="">company tax return</a> needs to be lodged each year if you operate with a company business structure.</p>
<p>Company tax returns must show:</p>
<ul>
<li>the company’s income</li>
<li>deductions</li>
<li>income tax the company is liable to pay</li>

<td>Capital gains tax (CGT)</td>
<td data-title="Sole trader">
<p>A capital gain or capital loss is the difference between what it cost you to get an asset and what you received when you disposed of it. If you made a capital gain from disposing an asset (for example, selling an asset) you owned for at least 12 months, you may be able to reduce the capital gain through: </p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="">discount method</a></li>
<li>the <a href="">indexation method</a></li>
<li>1 or more of the <a href="">4 CGT concessions</a> available for small business</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td data-title="Company">
<p>Generally, the <a href="">discount method</a> does not apply to companies when calculating capital gains, although it can apply to a limited number of capital gains made by life insurance companies.</p>
<p>If your company (other than a listed investment company) meets the conditions of the <a href="">indexation method</a> for calculating your capital gain, you must use the indexation method.</p>

There are a number of ways to advertise your business, including through:</p>
<ul>
<li>having your own <a href="">business website</a> – provides a way for people to reach your business and details in their own time and location. You may even be able to set it up so you can sell your goods or services directly from your website</li>
<li><a href="">social media</a> – engage with your customers and advertise your business by sharing your messages with your audience online</li>
<li>email newsletters or blogs – regularly create content related to your business to keep your audience engaged. If using an email newsletter, it’s important that you get permission before you send emails to people</li>
<li>newspapers and magazines – have a print advertisement or list your services within the classifieds</li>
<li>television – advertising on television can be costly, but can help you reach a large audience</li>
<li>radio – similar to advertising on television, though the cost is usually less and the audience reach is more localised</li>
<li>mail – dropping advertisements in mailboxes can be a simple cost effective way to reach your local area</li>
<li>phone books and directories – have your business listed on various business directories so you can be found by potential customers when they’re looking for a service.</li>
</ul>
<p>When choosing the best way to advertise your business, consider the audience you are trying to reach, as well as the costs involved. You don't have to spend a lot of money to advertise and promote your brand, so choose what is likely to be the most effective for your business.</p>

The National Construction Code and the Australian Building Codes Board have <a href="">handbooks</a> and <a href="">energy efficiency requirements</a> to help you improve the energy efficiency of your commercial building.</p>
<h3>Leasing a green building</h3>
<p>If you’re looking to lease a building, you can reduce your energy costs by choosing a building that already has energy saving measures. Look at the energy rating of the building to help you choose. You could also consider a <a href="">green lease</a> where you and the building owner jointly agree to work towards reducing energy use. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<h3>Energy ratings</h3>
<p>Energy ratings are an important tool for comparing the energy efficiency of appliances. The <a href="">energy rating label</a> helps you compare products before you buy. Download the free <a href="">energy rating app</a> to compare running costs of appliances.</p>
<p>If you supply electrical appliances, you must meet manufacturing and labelling laws that show the energy efficiency of your products. Read the <a href="">suppliers</a> information on the Energy rating website to find your legal obligations.</p>
<p>Retailers or tradies – such as lighting retailers and plumbers – must register energy efficiency products and make sure the rating label is displayed at point of sale. Visit the <a href="">retailers and tradies</a> page on the Energy rating website to find out more.</p>
<h3>Fuel efficiency</h3>
<p>Choosing a fuel efficient <a href="">vehicle</a> or <a href="">truck</a> can save your business money and reduce greenhouse and air pollution emissions.</p>
<p>Fuel-efficient cars also have a higher threshold for the <a href="">luxury car tax</a> and some insurers may offer discounts. Consider fuel and maintenance costs when choosing which vehicle is right for your business.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

There is a lot of variation in the costs of different energy plans.</p>
<p>Depending on the size and location of your business you can choose different types of energy contract:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="">Standard retail offers</a></strong> – basic contracts with minimum terms and conditions. These usually suit smaller energy users.</li>
<li><strong><a href="">Market retail contracts</a></strong>– contracts between you and your energy retailer. These contracts mostly suit businesses with lower energy use.</li>
<li><strong>Market contract (negotiated) </strong>– large energy users may wish to choose a market contract where you negotiate all of the contract. This is usually based on market prices, so you may be more exposed to price changes. These contracts can save you money if you <a href="">understand your energy needs </a>and actively manage your usage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Negotiate your energy contract</h3>
<p>It’s possible to negotiate a better deal from your existing or a new energy company. Just make sure you prepare well. Here are 6 tips to help you get the best price.</p>
<ol class="body-copy-list-order">
<li><strong>Provide detailed usage data</strong> - The more an energy provider knows about your current usage, the less likely they are to charge you a premium. Aim to give them at least 12 months of data showing your energy use for each half-hour period. You can get this data from your current energy provider.</li>
<li><strong>Look at your contract carefully</strong> - For smaller businesses on market retail contracts, ask the provider about terms and conditions. Pay attention to details on pricing and any discounts with an offer, such as pay on time discounts. If you negotiate your contract, review it before making any changes to your energy use or contract. Look for any special clauses such as a ‘take-or-pay’ clause. This means if you use less than a minimum amount of energy you still have to pay. Contracts and clauses vary between energy retailers. Do some research or talk to an energy broker about your options.</li>
<li><strong>Shop around</strong> - You can easily do an <a href="">online search</a> on the Australian Energy Regulator website to see how your energy contract compares to similar businesses. Consider an energy broker or third party to get a better deal. Make sure you include any broker or exit fees in your comparison. Search the Energy Made Easy website to <a href="">compare electricity and gas offers</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Go to market at the right time</strong> - If you negotiate a contract, you don’t have to wait until the end of your contract to get a better deal. Energy prices can change throughout the year, so consider negotiating when prices are lower.</li>
<li><strong>Choose the best contract period</strong> - The length of your energy contract is another way you can save money. In a rising market, where current prices are cheaper than future prices, it may be better to choose a longer contract. In a decreasing market it may be better to select a short period, so you can buy cheaper energy in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Plan for the future</strong> - When negotiating your contract, it’s important to consider any major changes you plan for your business. If you plan to expand your operations, consider a shorter contract until you have a better idea of the energy you’ll need.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Leasing</strong> – this reduces the up-front cost of switching to more energy efficient equipment.</li>
<li><strong>On-bill financing </strong>– the retailer provides you with the energy efficiency equipment in return for regular repayments on your energy bill. </li>
<li><strong>Energy performance contracts</strong> – common in the commercial building sector. Energy service companies reduce your energy bill by retrofitting the building and using the energy saved to fund the costs.</li>

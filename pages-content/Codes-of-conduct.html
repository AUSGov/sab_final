They can guard against misconduct and opportunistic behaviour, while fostering long term changes to business culture. </p>
<p>They can be described as a set of rules or standards of conduct for an industry, including the relationship between industry participants or their customers.</p>
<p>Codes of conduct can be mandatory or voluntary:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prescribed mandatory codes</strong> provide a set of rules or minimum standards for an industry, including the relationship between industry participants or their customers. They are prescribed as regulations under Competition and Consumer Act 2010. Go to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) website find out the <a href="">industry codes</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Non-prescribed voluntary codes</strong> are a form of industry self-regulation. Voluntary industry codes are usually flexible and can change in response to industry or consumer needs. They set out specific standards of conduct for an industry including how to deal with its members and customers. Go to the ACCC website to learn more about <a href="">voluntary codes</a>.</li>

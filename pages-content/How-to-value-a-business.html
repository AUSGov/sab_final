Choose a valuation method </h2> </div><hr/></div><div class="body-copy-content"><p>Keep in mind that there is no one set valuation method. You could use a combination of methods to get your final value. You may also need to negotiate the method of valuation with a buyer or investor.</p>
<p>If you use a professional, they can help you decide which method is best for your business. Some common methods for calculating the value of a business include using:</p>
<ul>
<li>current market values</li>
<li>return on investment</li>
<li>business asset value</li>
<li>cost of starting a business from scratch</li>
<li>future profit of a business</li>
</ul>
<h3>Look at current marketplace value and your industry</h3>
<p>How you value your business can depend heavily on the industry you're in, and the current marketplace value of similar businesses.</p>
<p>Industries usually come up with their own rules and formulas to value a business. So, it's a good idea to get a good understanding for your particular industry.</p>
<h3>Use the return on investment method to calculate value</h3>
<p>If you’re selling your business, the return on investment (ROI) method uses your business' net profit to work out its value. You can either calculate:</p>
<ul>
<li>an ROI based on a selling price (value) you have in mind, or</li>
<li>a selling price based on an ROI that you set</li>
</ul></div></div></div></div></div></div>
<div id="react_0HLTC2K1IEQE1"><div class="c-wrapper c-wrapper-bg-transparent container-fluid" data-reactroot="" style="background-color:"><div class="row"><div class="c-padding-top c-padding-bottom anchor-section-full-width col-sm-8 offset-sm-2"><div class="call-out"><div class="call-out-content"><div class="call-out-content-detail"><h4>ROI = (net annual profit/selling price) x 100</h4>
<p>For example, you have a selling price of $200,000 in mind, but want to test your ROI based on that price. You calculate that your business' net profit was $50,000 for the past year.</p>
<p>To work out the ROI, you use the formula:</p>
<p>ROI = (50,000/200,000) x 100</p>
<p>In this case, your ROI is 25%.</p>
<p>If you have an ROI in mind, you can use it to calculate the price for your business:</p>
<h4>Value (selling price) = (net annual profit/ROI) x 100</h4>
<p>Say you wanted a ROI of at least 50% for the sale of your business. If your business' net profit for the past year was $100,000, you could work out the minimum selling price you should set.</p>
<p>Selling price = (100,000/50) x 100</p>
<p>In this case, to achieve a ROI of at least 50%, you'll need to sell your business for at least $200,000.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
<div id="react_0HLTC2K1IEQE2"><div class="c-wrapper c-wrapper-bg-transparent container-fluid" data-reactroot="" style="background-color:"><div class="row"><div class="c-padding-top anchor-section-full-width c-padding-bottom col-sm-8 offset-sm-2 col-md-8 offset-md-2"><div class="body-copy"><div class="body-copy-content"><h3>Use your business' assets to calculate net worth</h3>
<p>When calculating the value of your business assets, make sure you include both tangible and intangible assets of your business.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tangible assets</strong> are physical things you can touch such as tools, equipment, and property.</li>
<li><strong>Intangible assets</strong> are things that can't be touched but are still valuable, such as intellectual property, brands and business goodwill.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you've calculated the total asset value of your business, use this as an indication of how much you’d like to sell your business for.</p>
<p>Assessing your business' assets value can be a complicated process. It's a good idea to ask your business advisor or accountant for help.</p>
<h4>Calculating business goodwill</h4>
<p>Goodwill can include:</p>
<ul class="body-copy-list-dot">
<li>customer loyalty and relations</li>
<li>brand recognition</li>
<li>staff performance</li>
<li>customer lists</li>
<li>reputation of your business</li>
<li>business operation procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>Calculating goodwill can be a complicated process. You’ll get different results depending on the method you use. You can use different methods to get a price range you’d like to set for your business goodwill. But in the end, the value is what the marketplace or buyer is willing to pay.</p>
<p>Because it's difficult to calculate goodwill, it's a good idea consult a professional such as your accountant.</p>
<h4>Account for depreciation</h4>
<p>If you use your business assets to calculate value, remember to account for depreciation. Depreciation is the loss of value for your assets over time. For example, you may have purchased a computer for your business 3 years ago for $1000. When calculating your business' asset value, the value of the computer will no longer be $1000.</p>
<p>Talk to your accountant if you're unsure how to work out depreciation of assets.</p>
<h3>Find the cost of creating your business from scratch</h3>
<p>The cost of creating your business from scratch can be used as a guide for valuing your business. This is the estimated cost to build a similar business in your industry in the current market. To calculate the cost, you'll need to include all costs involved when starting from scratch, like:</p>
<ul class="body-copy-list-dot">
<li>buying stock</li>
<li>buying equipment and tools</li>
<li>getting licenses and permits</li>
<li>recruiting, training and employing staff</li>
<li>developing products</li>
<li>marketing and promotion</li>
<li>buying or leasing premises</li>
<li>setting up online</li>
</ul>
<h3>Estimate the future profit of your business</h3>
<p>For a buyer or investor, the biggest value of your business will be its future profits. You're more likely to get finance or sell for a good price if you show your business will probably be profitable. Show this through your financial statements to give investors an idea of the returns they could expect from your business.</p>
<p>Estimate the future profit of your business by looking at trends in your business finances from past years. You can also look at trends for similar businesses in your industry. This can show how your business compares and how the market is going. Use this information when negotiating finance or a selling price for your business.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

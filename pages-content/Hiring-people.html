<ul>
<li>the type of position/s you’re offering</li>
<li>the entitlements, including wages, that you’ll need to pay your employee/s</li>
<li>any paperwork you need to complete</li>
</ul>
<h3>Employment type</h3>
<p>When looking at the position/s you’re hiring someone for, it’s important to consider which employment type you need. Each type of employment can mean a different set of responsibilities for you and the person you employ.</p>
<p>Depending on your requirements for the role, you might consider employing a:</p>
<ul>
<li>permanent (full-time or part-time) employee </li>
<li>casual employee </li>
<li>trainee or apprentice </li>
<li>temporary employee (possibly through an employment agency) </li>
<li>contractor (working for a fixed term and who have their own business)</li>
</ul>
<p>Find out more about the different <a href="">types of employment</a>.</p>
<h3>Employee or contractor</h3>
<p>It’s important to make sure you are aware of the differences between employees and contractors when you hire someone, as there are different tax, super and other responsibilities. </p>
<p>The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">Employee/contractor decision tool</a> can help you work out whether your worker is an employee or contractor for tax purposes.</p>
<p>If your <a href="">worker is an <strong>employee</strong></a> you'll need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>withhold tax (<a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">PAYG withholding</a>) from their wages and report and pay the withheld amounts to the ATO</li>
<li><a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">pay super contributions</a> to their superfund at least four times a year by the quarterly due dates </li>
<li>report and pay <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">fringe benefits tax</a> (FBT) to the ATO, if you provide your employee with fringe benefits</li>
</ul>
<p>If your <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">worker is a <strong>contractor</strong></a> you:</p>
<ul>
<li>don't have to withhold tax from payments to them, unless they fail to quote a valid Australian business number (ABN) or you have a voluntary agreement with them</li>
<li>don't have FBT obligations</li>
<li>may still have to <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">pay super for individual contractors</a> if the contract is mainly for their labour.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can use the Tax withheld calculator and the Super guarantee contributions calculator in the <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="http://www.ato.gov.au/app">ATO app</a> to work out how much tax to withhold or how much super to pay.</p>

<p>You might be tempted to employ family or friends when you are starting a business. Before you do it’s important to consider if they’ll suit your business needs. Recruiting unsuitable staff can be costly, both financially and time-wise, which can be further complicated if you have an existing relationship with them. </p>
<p>Before you begin recruiting, you need to develop a job description of the type of worker you're looking for and the skills and knowledge they need to have.</p>
<p>You can recruit staff yourself, or you can use a recruitment agency. If you decide to use a recruitment agency, ask your colleagues and business partners to recommend a reputable one that has experience with your type of business.</p>
<h3>The recruitment process</h3>
<p>If you manage the recruitment process yourself, the steps to follow generally include:</p>
<ol>
<li>advertise the job</li>
<li>evaluate the applications</li>
<li>conduct interviews and reference checks</li>
<li>select the best candidate</li>
</ol>
<h4>Advertising the position</h4>
<p>Before you advertise the position, think about the kind of worker you are looking for and the best way to target them, as well as any costs involved. </p>
<p>Some ways to advertise your position include:</p>
<ul>
<li>using online job sites such as <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">Australian Jobsearch</a></li>
<li>advertising in newspapers and industry publications</li>
<li>placing an ad on your website or social media page</li>
<li>through your business or industry contacts</li>
<li>placing an ad on notice boards or shop windows</li>
<li>using a recruitment agency</li>
</ul>
<h4>Finding and selecting the right candidates</h4>
<p>To find the right people for your position:</p>
<ul>
<li>prepare a job advertisement for the position listing th    <ul>
<li>skills and experience you are looking for</li>
<li>location of where they will be working</li>
<li>salary and benefits of the job.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>interview candidates and ask questions that focus on the skills and abilities needed for the role</li>
<li>consider the qualities that would fit into your work environment</li>
<li>shortlist candidates whose skills and experience best match the role</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hiring people from overseas</h3>
<p>If you’re considering hiring workers from overseas, you must make sure they have the correct type of visa and are allowed to work in Australia.</p>
<p>Overseas workers can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>workers with professional or trade qualifications</li>
<li>international students</li>
<li>people on a working holiday</li>
<li>refugees.</li>
</ul>
<p>To check if an overseas worker has a visa which allows them to work in Australia, you can use the free online service <a href="">Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO)</a>.</p>
<p>Overseas workers are covered by the same entitlements and awards as Australian workers. These entitlements are outlined in the <a href="">National Employment Standards (NES)</a>.</p>
<p>Australian citizens, Australian permanent residents and New Zealand citizens have unlimited permission to work in Australia.</p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are hiring a working holiday maker who has a Working Holiday visa (subclass 417) or Work and Holiday visa (subclass 462) you will need to withhold tax from the first dollar they earn.</li>
<li>The Department of Home Affairs has an online service called <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">SkillSelect</a>, which connects employers with overseas workers whom have essential skills and attributes needed to fill skill shortages.</li>

<p>It’s also a good idea to consider induction training for your new employees.</p>
<h3>Tax file number (TFN) declaration</h3>
<p>New employees need to complete a tax file number (TFN) declaration form. The information they provide in the form will help you to work out how much tax you need to take out of their pay.</p>
<p>You need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>give them a <a href="">Tax file number declaration form</a> to complete and return to you</li>
<li>complete the <a href="">payer section</a> of the form with your business details</li>
<li>keep a copy of the completed form for your records</li>
<li>send the original completed form to the address on the form within 14 days (or if you already report online you can <a href="">lodge TFN declaration data online</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
<p>An employee may also give you a Withholding declaration. To find out more read <a href="">Tax file number and withholding declarations</a> on the Australian Taxation Office website.</p>
<h3>Superannuation</h3>
<p>Superannuation (or ‘super’) is money you need to pay to a super fund for eligible employees and some contractors, to provide for their retirement. This is called <strong>super guarantee</strong> and it applies to full-time, part-time, and casual employees.</p>
<p>To determine if you have to pay super, read <a href="">Working out if you have to pay super</a> on the ATO website.</p>
<p>As an employer you’ll need to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="">determine a default super fund</a> to use if your employee can't or doesn't choose their own fund (also called the employer nominated fund)</li>
<li>give eligible employees a <a href="">standard choice form</a> to complete</li>
<li>calculate the minimum <a href="">contribution amount</a> you will need to pay on <a href="">ordinary time earnings</a></li>
<li>pay the super guarantee amount:    <ul>
<li>to your default super fund or to the super fund your employee has indicated on the standard choice form</li>
<li>by the <a href="">due date each quarter</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="">provide employee tax file numbers (TFNs)</a> to their super fund within 14 days of receiving a TFN declaration form (or if you don't make contributions in those 14 days, you can provide the TFNs when you make the first contribution)</li>
<li>keep <a href="">records of super contribution payments</a> and that a choice of super fund has been offered to eligible employees</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Did you know?</strong></h4>
<p>Under <a href="">SuperStream</a> you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>pay super contributions for your employees electronically (through EFT or BPAY)</li>
<li>send the associated data electronically in a standard format</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the ATOs <a href="">Employer checklist: a step-by-step guide</a> for help with choosing a SuperStream solution to suit your business.</p>

<p>Fringe benefits tax (FBT) is a tax you need to pay if you provide certain benefits to your employees outside of their salary.</p>
<p>There are various <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">types of fringe benefits</a> including:</p>
<ul>
<li>allowing your employee to use a work car for private purposes (this includes driving between work and home)</li>

<p>When your employee first starts working for you, it’s important to think about how you can best prepare them for working in your business. Taking the time to prepare a good induction will help you get the best out of your employees. It’ll also make sure that your employee feels informed, welcomed and ready to do their job.</p>
<p>You may want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>meet with your new employee to set goals and let them know your expectations</li>
<li>work out their training needs and how you will provide training for them during the first few weeks</li>
<li>schedule regular catch-ups to talk about how they’re going.</li>

<ul>
<li>Use the FWO's <a href="">Pay Calculator</a> to work out how much to pay your employees.</li>
<li>Please note that in Western Australia (WA), sole traders and partnerships in the <a href="">WA industrial relations system</a> should refer to <a href="">WA pay rates</a> and <a href="">WA hours of work, overtime and penalty rates</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also need to consider if your employees have entitlements to paid public holidays, annual or recreation leave, sick leave, long service leave, paid parental leave, overtime and penalty rates.</p>

<h3>Pay as you go (PAYG) withholding</h3>
<p>When you pay employees and some businesses, you need to take tax out of their pay and send it to the ATO. This is called pay as you go (PAYG) withholding.</p>
<p>This applies to payments you make to:</p>
<ul>
<li>all employees</li>
<li>workers that you have <a href="">voluntary agreements</a> with</li>
<li>contractors or businesses that <a href="">don't quote their Australian Business Number</a><span> (ABN)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To begin, you will first need to <a href="">register for PAYG withholding</a>.</p>
